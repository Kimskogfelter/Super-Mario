![picture of the mockup of the website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Safari-Retreat/main/assets/images/readme/mockup-safari-retreat.webp)

### PURPOSE

---

 My first thought when starting this project was to make a fun and easy game for my two toddler boys who love Super Mario at the moment. And what game can be better then a memory game that includes pictures of different creatures from the Super Mario game. A memory game fits everyone who wants to train their memory and speed skill. Both kids and adults can play due to its easy design and mecanics. The user need to find two pictures of the same creature to score a point. The game got a timer that starts as soon as you press "play". The user can also pause the game at the same button that says "play" at the beginning of entering the page. As soon as you press "play" the button changes to "stop game" and the user can deside to pause the game when they need to. The timer continues to count until the user have found all the matching cards. The game also got a "moves" tracker who shows how many moves a user has taken during the game.  

### UX DESIGN

- The site is also responsive which I tested in google chromes devtools by selecting different screensizes and test each function
- I tested that all text is easy to read and to understand
- The code got valified through both CSS and HTML validators

#### BUGS

- when I first deployed this project the images and css code didnt work. the solution was to correct all the pathways to relative ones insted of absolute.
